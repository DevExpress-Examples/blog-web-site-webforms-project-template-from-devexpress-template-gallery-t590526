# Blog Web Site (WebForms project template from DevExpress Template Gallery)


This website is based on the Blog Web Site project template available in the DevExpress Template Gallery. This template utilizes DevExpress ASP.NET AJAX controls in conjunction with the Bootstrap framework to create a website with multi-page design and responsive, mobile-friendly interface out of the box. By default, the website has a format of a blog with integrated full-text search - see <a href="https://codecentral.devexpress.com/T590526/Pages/Search.aspx">search.aspx page</a>.<br><br>If you are using a custom Bootstrap theme, it is recommended that you manually modify the base color in the DevExpress theme of your choice to better suit the overall color scheme. You can accomplish this task by <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/118729/Common-Concepts/Appearance-Customization-Theming/Changing-Theme-Base-Color-and-Font-Settings">changing Theme Base Color</a>.<br><br>==<br>See also (MVC version): <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T591214">Blog Web Site (MVC project template from DevExpress Template Gallery)</a>
